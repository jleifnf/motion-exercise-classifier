# Exercise recognition from Wearables data
Sales of smart wearable devices have been increasing. Approximately 31 million Apple Watch units were sold worldwide in the year 2019 according to CNET and estimated to reach 134 million units in 2020 according to MarketWatch. Fitness and health applications in mobile are also on the rise.

Majority of the fitness trackers or exercise mobile apps have yet to utilize machine learning (CNN-LSTM) to automatically recognize the activity. This project uses wearable motion data (from RecoFit of Microsoft Research) to train the model for automatically recognizing exercise.
